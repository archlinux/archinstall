python-archinstall Documentation
================================

| **python-archinstall** *(or, archinstall for short)* is a helper library to install Arch Linux and manage services, packages and other things.
| It comes packaged with different pre-configured installers, such as the `Guided installation`_ installer.
| 
| A demo can be viewed here: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xt7X_Iqg6E <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xt7X_Iqg6E>`_ which uses the default guided installer.

.. warning::
    This installer currently requires that your machine has EFI-mode enabled.

Some of the features of Archinstall are:

* **No external dependencies or installation requirements.** Runs without any external requirements or installation processes.

* **Single threaded and context friendly.** The library always executed calls in sequential order to ensure installation-steps don't overlap or executes in the wrong order. It also supports *(and uses)* context wrappers to ensure things such as `sync` are called so data and configurations aren't lost.

* **Supports standalone executable** The library can be compiled into a single executable and run on any system with or without Python. This is ideal for live mediums that don't want to ship Python as a big dependency.
