General questions, enhancements and security issues can be reported over there too.
For quick issues or if you need help, head over to the Discord server which has a help channel.

Submitting a help ticket
========================

| When submitting a help ticket, please include the :code:`/var/log/archinstall/install.log`.
| It can be found both on the live ISO but also in the installed filesystem if the base packages were strapped in.

| There are additional worker files, these worker files contain individual command input and output.
| These worker files are located in :code:`~/.cache/archinstall/` and do not need to be submitted by default when submitting issues.

.. warning::

    Worker log-files *may* contain sensitive information such as **passwords** and **private information**. Never submit these logs without going through them manually making sure they're good for submission. Or submit only parts of them which are relevant to the issue itself.
