Known Issues
============

| Some issues are out of the `archinstall`_ projects scope, and the ones we know of are listed below.

.. _waiting for time sync:

Waiting for time sync `#2144`_
------------------------------

| The usual root cause of this is the network topology.
| More specifically `timedatectl show`_ cannot perform a proper time sync against the default servers.

| Restarting ``systemd-timesyncd.service`` might work but most often you need to configure ``/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf`` to match your network design.

.. note::

   If you know your time is correct on the machine, you can run ``archinstall --skip-ntp`` to ignore time sync.

Missing Nvidia Proprietary Driver `#2002`_
------------------------------------------

| In some instances, the nvidia driver might not have all the necessary packages installed.
| This is due to the kernel selection and/or hardware setups requiring additional packages to work properly.

A common workaround is to install the package `linux-headers`_ and `nvidia-dkms`_

ARM, 32bit and other CPU types error out `#1686`_, `#2185`_
-----------------------------------------------------------

| This is a bit of a catch-all known issue.
| Officially `x86_64`_ is only supported by Arch Linux.
| Hence little effort have been put into supporting other platforms.

| In theory, other architectures should work but small quirks might arise.

| PR's are welcome but please be respectful of the delays in merging.
| Other fixes, issues or features will be prioritized for the above reasons.

Keyring is out of date `#2213`_
-------------------------------

| Missing key-issues tend to be that the `archlinux-keyring`_ package is out of date, usually as a result of an outdated ISO.
| There is an attempt from upstream to fix this issue, and it's the `archlinux-keyring-wkd-sync.service`_

| The service starts almost immediately during boot, and if network is not configured in time â€” the service will fail.
| Subsequently the ``archinstall`` run might operate on a old keyring despite there being an update service for this.

| There is really no way to reliably over time work around this issue in ``archinstall``.
| Instead, efforts to the upstream service should be considered the way forward. And/or keys not expiring between a sane amount of ISO's.

.. note::

   The issue can happen on new ISO's too even as little as a few days after release, as some keys might expire right after the keyring is *"burnt in"* to the ISO.

.. note::

   Another common issue relating to the network not being configured, is that time might not be set correctly - resulting in the keyring not being able to update. See :ref:`waiting for time sync`.

AUR packages
------------

| This is also a catch-all issue.
| `AUR is unsupported <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Updating_packages>`_, and until that changes we cannot use AUR packages to solve feature requests in ``archinstall``.

| This means that feature requests like supporting filesystems such as `ZFS`_ can not be added, and issues cannot be solved by using AUR packages either.

.. note::

   But in spirit of giving the community options, ``archinstall`` supports :ref:`archinstall.Plugins`, which means you can run ``archinstall --plugin <url>`` and source an AUR plugin.

   `torxed/archinstall-aur <https://github.com/torxed/archinstall-aur>`_ is a reference implementation for plugins:

   .. code-block:: console

      # archinstall --plugin https://archlinux.life/aur-plugin

   `phisch/archinstall-aur <https://github.com/phisch/archinstall-aur>`_ is another alternative:

   .. code-block:: console

      # archinstall --plugin https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phisch/archinstall-aur/master/archinstall-aur.py

   .. warning::

      This will allow for unsupported usage of AUR during installation.
