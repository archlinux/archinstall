# This file contains GitLab CI/CD configuration for the ArchInstall project.
# It defines several jobs that get run when a new commit is made, and is comparable to the GitHub workflows.
# There is an expectation that a runner exists that has the --privileged flag enabled for the build ISO job to run correctly.
# These jobs should leverage the same tag as that runner. If necessary, change the tag from 'docker' to the one it uses.
# All jobs will be run in the official archlinux container image, so we will declare that here.

image: archlinux:latest

# This can be used to handle common actions. In this case, we do a pacman -Sy to make sure repos are ready to use.

## This job only runs when a tag is created on the master branch. This is because we do not want to try to publish to PyPi every time we commit.
## The following CI/CD variables need to be set to the PyPi username and password in the GitLab project's settings for this stage to work.
# * FLIT_USERNAME
# * FLIT_PASSWORD
