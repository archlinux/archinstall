	Uses systemd-cryptenroll to list the FIDO2 devices

	Some devices might show up in udevadm as FIDO2 compliant

	The drawback of systemd-cryptenroll is that it uses human readable format.
	That means we get this weird table like structure that is of no use.

	So we'll look for `MANUFACTURER` and `PRODUCT`, we take their index
	and we split each line based on those positions.
